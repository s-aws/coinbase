# Admin API Examples

These examples describe the current enterprise Admin API contract. Mutating
HTTP endpoints are authenticated, permission-checked, idempotent, and audited,
then return `not_implemented`; they do not call Coinbase. Read-only spot
operator endpoints are available behind the same fail-closed auth dependency.

## Cancel By Client Order ID

Current skeleton shape:

```http
POST /api/v1/orders/{client_order_id}/cancel
Authorization: Bearer <backend-verifiable-token>
Idempotency-Key: 018f1a2b-4b9c-7e20-9d39-7d6c4a5f1082
X-Correlation-Id: corr-20260610-001
X-Operator-Intent: operator_cancel
X-Admin-Actor: operator-001
X-Admin-Roles: trader
```

Current backend behavior:

- parse the request through FastAPI/Pydantic
- authenticate actor and authorize `order:cancel`
- evaluate durable idempotency
- call the shared command service with HTTP live execution disabled
- write durable command audit evidence
- return `501` with `status: "not_implemented"`
- never call Coinbase

Future live execution must call the project Coinbase wrapper
`cancel_order(client_order_id)` after rate/cap policy is complete. The wrapper
must parse Coinbase cancel payloads and accept only explicit `success: true`
evidence as a successful exchange cancellation.

## Live Placement Approval

Current skeleton shape:

```json
{
  "product_id": "BTC-USDC",
  "side": "BUY",
  "order_type": "LIMIT",
  "quote_size": "1.00",
  "limit_price": "65000.00",
  "manual_live_acknowledgement": true
}
```

Required headers for that placement include:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <backend-verifiable-token>
Idempotency-Key: 018f1a2b-4b9c-7e20-9d39-7d6c4a5f1083
X-Correlation-Id: corr-20260610-002
X-Operator-Intent: manual_one_off
X-Admin-Actor: trader-001
X-Admin-Roles: trader
```

Current backend behavior:

- parse the request through FastAPI/Pydantic
- authenticate actor and authorize `order:create`
- evaluate durable idempotency
- write durable command audit evidence
- return `501` with `status: "not_implemented"`
- never call Coinbase

Future backend behavior:

- validate product capability and size
- run action-condition guards
- enforce live caps
- create or verify an approval snapshot
- mint one `client_order_id`
- persist idempotency and audit state
- submit to Coinbase only after all gates pass

## Idempotent Retry

If the same `Idempotency-Key` and same payload are sent again, the API should
return the original command result without minting a second `client_order_id`
or submitting a second Coinbase order.

If the same `Idempotency-Key` is reused with a different payload, the API
should return conflict.

## Read-Only Spot Operator Routes

Read-only routes require `Authorization`, `X-Admin-Actor`, and
`X-Admin-Roles`. They do not require `Idempotency-Key`.
Missing or invalid auth returns `401`; insufficient role evidence returns
`403`.

```http
GET /api/v1/spot/readiness?product_id=BTC-USDC
Authorization: Bearer <backend-verifiable-token>
X-Admin-Actor: viewer-001
X-Admin-Roles: viewer
```

Current read-only routes:

- `GET /api/v1/spot/readiness`
- `GET /api/v1/spot/sweep/status`
- `GET /api/v1/spot/sweep/pnl`
- `GET /api/v1/spot/cost-basis/status`
- `GET /api/v1/spot/campaign/status`
- `GET /api/v1/spot/direct-orders/{client_order_id}/audit`
