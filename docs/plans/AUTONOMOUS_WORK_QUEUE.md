# Autonomous Work Queue

This document records durable approval for unattended work on this project.
It exists so a contextless maintainer or agent can continue approved work
without relying on chat history.

## Active Approval

- Approved phase range: **1361-1380**.
- Work may continue through the approved range without asking for another
  approval when the work stays inside the phase scope and cap policy below.
- The prior live Coinbase cap posture is carried forward, but live execution
  remains exceptional. Default work is dry/no-live.
- If any stop condition occurs, resolve it before advancing to the next phase.

## Live Coinbase Cap Policy

Default: no live Coinbase execution.

When a phase explicitly requires live Coinbase evidence under the carried
forward cap approval:

- Product scope: cheapest Coinbase `USDC` spot product available to US
  customers.
- Maximum total submitted notional: `3.10` USDC.
- Maximum total executed notional: `1.00` USDC.
- Retain inventory unless a phase explicitly says otherwise.
- Reconciliation gate must pass before the phase can be considered complete.
- Final summary must state product, submitted notional, executed notional,
  retained inventory, and reconciliation result.
- Frontend release, deployment, artifact, and smoke gates remain no-live and
  must report `$0` notional.

## Stop Conditions

Stop advancement to the next phase until fixed when any of these occur:

- `pytest tests\regression\ -v --tb=short` fails after backend changes.
- Frontend `npm run release:gate` fails after frontend release/BFF/API work.
- A blind/contextless review finds a blocking ambiguity or unsafe path.
- A security review finds browser-trusted authority, secret exposure, or live
  command bypass risk.
- Live Coinbase reconciliation fails, live notional exceeds the cap, or exact
  product/notional evidence is missing.
- The worktree contains unrelated changes that affect the files in scope.
- A requested change would create a parallel implementation for existing
  behavior.

## Active Phases 1361-1380

### Phase 1361 - Advance Active Queue Range

- Move the durable autonomous queue from completed phases 1341-1360 to active
  phases 1361-1380 while preserving the same no-live frontend posture and
  carried Coinbase cap policy.

### Phase 1362 - M43 Disabled Live Execution Service Foundation

- Add a backend-owned disabled live execution service descriptor that command
  admission can consume as evidence without adding execution methods, a live
  switch, browser approval, BFF execution authority, or Coinbase calls.

### Phase 1363 - Backend Range Evidence

- Keep backend live-enablement, enterprise-readiness, autonomous, and runtime
  checks reporting the 1361-1380 phase range.

  reconciliation proof resolve, admission remains blocked by
  `live_execution_disabled` and `browser_authority_rejected`.

  `13` required fields and `13` missing required fields.
- Focused backend gates passed with `63` tests and `1` warning; backend
  autonomous queue check passed.

## Completed Phases 881-900

### Phase 881 - Advance Active Queue Range

- Move the durable autonomous queue from completed phases 861-880 to active
  phases 881-900 while preserving the same cap and stop-condition policy.

### Phase 882 - M19 Command Dry-Submit Audit Traceability

- Add operator-facing traceability from command dry-submit results to the
  existing read-only audit workbench anchors.

### Phase 883 - Backend Range Evidence

- Update backend no-live readiness evidence so live-enablement and
  enterprise-readiness report the active 881-900 phase range.

### Phase 884 - Milestone Index Normalization

- Update durable milestone status tables so M12-M18 are listed as complete
  and M19 is the active milestone.

### Phase 885 - Audit Anchor Contract Confirmation

- Confirm the existing audit workbench anchors remain keyed by
  `client_order_id`, `correlation_id`, and `audit_id` without introducing a
  new trace route or browser authority.

### Phase 886 - Command Submitted Trace Link Model

- Build dry-submit trace links from submitted backend evidence only; blocked
  preview states must not expose audit links.

### Phase 887 - Manual Order Trace Links

- Link manual order dry-submit evidence to audit workbench anchors by
  `client_order_id`, correlation id, and audit id when present.

### Phase 888 - Cancel Trace Links

- Link cancel dry-submit evidence by `client_order_id`, correlation id, and
  audit id without accepting exchange `order_id` as identity.

### Phase 889 - Stealth Cancel Trace Links

- Link stealth cancel dry-submit evidence by `stealth_order_id`, correlation
  id, and audit id while preserving active placement evidence as read-only.

### Phase 890 - Movement Reprice Trace Links

- Link movement reprice dry-submit evidence by `stealth_order_id`,
  correlation id, and audit id without mutating repricing state.

### Phase 891 - Campaign Trace Links

- Link campaign dry-submit evidence by correlation id and audit id while
  keeping campaign execution dry-run and live-disabled.

### Phase 892 - Audit Workbench No-New-Route Guard

- Keep traceability on the existing read-only audit workbench route and
  update guards if needed so no feature-local fetch or new audit mutation
  path is introduced.

### Phase 893 - Frontend Unit Tests

- Add focused tests for dry-submit trace links, blocked-state absence of
  links, and audit anchor hrefs.

### Phase 894 - Route And Security Guard Update

- Extend route/security checks if needed so command traceability remains a
  link to backend evidence, not a new command or audit fetch path.

### Phase 895 - Documentation Update

- Update command workflow, audit workbench, API contract, testing, and
  examples docs for the traceability contract.

### Phase 896 - Stale Range And Drift Scan

- Search for current-state contradictions around 861-880 versus 881-900 and
  around dry-submit audit traceability.

### Phase 897 - Backend Focused Gates

- Run backend autonomous queue and focused Admin API/spot readiness checks.

### Phase 898 - Frontend Focused Gates And Contextless Review

- Run frontend focused checks and blind/contextless review for dry-submit
  traceability and audit identity discipline.

### Phase 899 - Full Gates

- Run full backend regression and frontend `npm run release:gate`.

### Phase 900 - Commit And Final Batch Summary

- Commit backend and frontend work separately, then summarize implementation,
  verification, live posture, commits, and next objective scope.

Completion evidence:

- Backend and frontend readiness evidence now report active approved range
  `881-900`.
- Durable milestone tables list M12-M18 complete and M19 active/completed
  evidence is documented below M18.
- Command dry-submit submitted results link to the existing read-only audit
  workbench anchors for `client_order_id`, `stealth_order_id`, correlation id,
  and audit id when those values are present.
- Blocked-before-request dry-submit states render no audit links because no
  backend audit attempt exists.
- Exchange-native `order_id` / `coinbase_order_id` remains exchange evidence
  only and is not used as a trace or cancellation identity.
- Traceability uses anchor navigation only; no new audit route, feature-local
  command fetch, audit mutation, or browser-owned authority was introduced.
- Focused backend gates passed: autonomous queue check and focused Admin
  API/spot readiness regression checks (`63` tests passed with `1` warning).
- Focused frontend gates passed: typecheck, route/security/release checks,
  autonomous queue check, and command/audit/mutation/runtime unit tests
  (`87` focused assertions passed).
- Blind/contextless M19 review passed with no blockers.
- Full backend regression passed: `790` tests passed with `1` warning.
- Full frontend release gate passed: `186` unit tests and `3` Playwright
  tests passed.
- Live Coinbase execution was not run; submitted notional `$0`, executed
  notional `$0`.
