# Autonomous Work Queue

This document records durable approval for unattended work on this project.
It exists so a contextless maintainer or agent can continue approved work
without relying on chat history.

## Active Approval

- Approved phase range: **661-680**.
- Work may continue through the approved range without asking for another
  approval when the work stays inside the phase scope and cap policy below.
- The prior live Coinbase cap posture is carried forward, but live execution
  remains exceptional. Default work is dry/no-live.
- If any stop condition occurs, resolve it before advancing to the next phase.

## Live Coinbase Cap Policy

Default: no live Coinbase execution.

When a phase explicitly requires live Coinbase evidence under the carried
forward cap approval:

- Product scope: cheapest Coinbase `USDC` spot product available to US
  customers.
- Maximum total submitted notional: `3.10` USDC.
- Maximum total executed notional: `1.00` USDC.
- Retain inventory unless a phase explicitly says otherwise.
- Reconciliation gate must pass before the phase can be considered complete.
- Final summary must state product, submitted notional, executed notional,
  retained inventory, and reconciliation result.
- Frontend release, deployment, artifact, and smoke gates remain no-live and
  must report `$0` notional.

## Stop Conditions

Stop advancement to the next phase until fixed when any of these occur:

- `pytest tests\regression\ -v --tb=short` fails after backend changes.
- Frontend `npm run release:gate` fails after frontend release/BFF/API work.
- A blind/contextless review finds a blocking ambiguity or unsafe path.
- A security review finds browser-trusted authority, secret exposure, or live
  command bypass risk.
- Live Coinbase reconciliation fails, live notional exceeds the cap, or exact
  product/notional evidence is missing.
- The worktree contains unrelated changes that affect the files in scope.
- A requested change would create a parallel implementation for existing
  behavior.

## Completed Phases 641-660

### Phase 641 - Advance Active Queue Range

- Move the durable autonomous queue from completed phases 621-640 to active
  phases 641-660 while preserving the same live cap and stop-condition policy.

### Phase 642 - M6 Command Draft Inventory Closure

- Update M6 milestone evidence so stealth cancel and movement reprice drafts
  are both documented as live-disabled command contracts.

### Phase 643 - Command Draft Capability Matrix Sync

- Sync the command-capability matrix across manual order, cancel, stealth
  cancel, movement reprice, and campaign execution drafts.

### Phase 644 - Command Workflow Evidence Matrix

- Add or refine frontend/backend evidence that shows each command draft's
  route, identity key, live-disabled posture, and audit/idempotency contract.

### Phase 645 - Dry Submit Consistency

- Ensure frontend dry-submit and backend command responses surface live
  evidence, correlation/audit ids, and fail-closed status consistently.

### Phase 646 - BFF Command Boundary Hardening

- Validate that command routes cannot be broadened accidentally through BFF
  or undocumented backend paths.

### Phase 647 - Command Fetch Guard Hardening

- Strengthen static command-fetch guard expectations around canonical
  frontend/backend command wrappers.

### Phase 648 - Operator Intent Audit Evidence

- Verify command drafts and docs preserve operator intent, idempotency, and
  audit evidence without using exchange ids as application identity.

### Phase 649 - M6 Contextless Command Review

- Run a blind/contextless review focused on command draft discoverability,
  backend authority, BFF boundaries, and no-live posture.

### Phase 650 - M6 Review Remediation

- Fix any blocker or unclear command-draft path found by the M6 review before
  advancing into production-auth work.

### Phase 651 - M7 Auth Boundary Inventory

- Inventory frontend, BFF, and backend auth boundaries for production OIDC,
  CSRF, CORS, session, role, and server-only secret handling.

### Phase 652 - Server Secret Exposure Tests

- Add or refine tests that prove Admin API bearer tokens, actor headers,
  roles, and CSRF authority stay server-side in BFF mode.

### Phase 653 - OIDC Readiness Operator UX

- Improve operator-facing OIDC/JWT readiness evidence without simulating
  browser-trusted production auth.

### Phase 654 - CSRF And CORS Deployment Evidence

- Strengthen deployment docs/artifacts for CSRF and CORS posture while keeping
  unsafe methods fail-closed.

### Phase 655 - Release Artifact Operations Evidence

- Expand release/deployment/runtime artifacts with auth, observability,
  command, and no-live evidence needed by enterprise operators.

### Phase 656 - Observability Correlation UX

- Improve request/correlation/audit evidence in diagnostics and command
  outputs without adding frontend data authority.

### Phase 657 - Human Operator Runbook Auth Path

- Update human operator runbooks for production auth/deployment setup,
  failure modes, and no-live verification.

### Phase 658 - Focused Verification

- Run focused frontend/backend checks for command drafts, BFF/auth
  boundaries, diagnostics, docs, and Playwright production-start smoke.

### Phase 659 - Backend Queue, Regression, And No-Live Evidence

- Run backend autonomous queue validation and full backend regression after
  backend queue/doc/checker changes, then confirm release and regression
  evidence ran no live Coinbase execution with notional `$0`.

### Phase 660 - Commit And Final Batch Summary

- Commit completed backend and frontend work separately, then summarize
  implementation, verification, live posture, commits, and next approved phase
  range.

## Completion Evidence - Phases 641-660

- Phase range 641-660 completed the M6 non-spot command draft contracts and
  M7 production auth/operations hardening evidence.
- Backend command contracts remain live-disabled for stealth cancel and
  movement reprice; both route through the shared Admin API command service,
  auth/RBAC, idempotency, audit, and approval gates.
- Frontend BFF mutation forwarding now rejects missing mutation evidence
  headers and rejects OIDC/JWT cookie-backed unsafe requests without
  same-origin browser evidence before forwarding.
- Command fetch guard hardening passed and continues to require canonical
  frontend wrappers for command routes.
- Blind/contextless review found M6 documentation ambiguity and an M7
  OIDC/CSRF browser-boundary blocker; both were remediated and follow-up
  review found no remaining blockers.
- Backend focused Admin API contract tests passed with `54 passed,
  1 warning`.
- Backend full regression passed with `789 passed, 1 warning`.
- Backend autonomous queue validation passed with status `passed`.
- Frontend focused command/auth contract tests passed with `72 passed`.
- Frontend `npm run security:commands` passed.
- Frontend `npm run release:gate` passed with `177` unit tests and `3`
  Playwright tests.
- Live Coinbase execution was not run; submitted notional `$0`, executed
  notional `$0`.

## Approved Phases 661-680

### Phase 661 - Advance Active Queue Range

- Move the durable autonomous queue from completed phases 641-660 to active
  phases 661-680 while preserving the same live cap and stop-condition policy.

### Phase 662 - M8 Live Path Inventory

- Define the backend-owned list of command paths that could ever become live
  through controlled M8 enablement, with every path still live-disabled by
  default.

### Phase 663 - Live Enablement Read Contract

- Add a read-only Admin API contract that exposes live path eligibility,
  cap posture, approval requirements, guard requirements, audit requirements,
  reconciliation requirements, and no-live evidence.

### Phase 664 - Backend Route Inventory Sync

- Sync route inventory, capabilities, OpenAPI, fixtures, and examples with
  the live-enablement readiness contract.

### Phase 665 - Backend No-Live Regression

- Add regression coverage proving the live-enablement route is read-only,
  reports submitted/executed notional `$0`, and does not enable any command
  path.

### Phase 666 - Frontend Schema And BFF Sync

- Regenerate the frontend schema, add canonical client/BFF read coverage, and
  keep the route out of mutation allowlists.

### Phase 667 - Frontend Live Evidence Surface

- Display live-enablement readiness as operator evidence only, including cap,
  eligible paths, required gates, and no-live posture.

### Phase 668 - Runtime And Mock Evidence

- Add runtime snapshot and mock-backend support so local, BFF, and backend
  modes all expose the same no-live M8 evidence shape.

### Phase 669 - Release Artifact Live Posture

- Extend release/runtime/deployment artifacts so M8 evidence appears in
  release proof without approving frontend live execution.

### Phase 670 - Human Operator M8 Runbook

- Document how operators should read M8 live-enablement evidence and why it is
  not live approval.

### Phase 671 - Capability Matrix M8 Sync

- Update backend/frontend capability matrices so controlled live enablement is
  a platform primitive, not a spot-only concept.

### Phase 672 - Reconciliation Gate Detail

- Document the per-path reconciliation evidence that must exist before any
  future live enablement can be marked complete.

### Phase 673 - Live Cap Drift Checks

- Add static/read-only checks that fail if approved cap values drift between
  queue docs, backend readiness, frontend artifacts, and tests.

### Phase 674 - Contextless M8 Review

- Run blind/contextless review focused on whether a fresh agent can explain
  the M8 path, no-live posture, cap policy, and reconciliation requirement.

### Phase 675 - Review Remediation

- Resolve any blocker from contextless M8 review before advancing to release
  candidate work.

### Phase 676 - Focused Backend Verification

- Run focused backend Admin API contract tests and queue validation for the
  M8 readiness surface.

### Phase 677 - Focused Frontend Verification

- Run focused frontend API, runtime, BFF, artifact, and UI tests for the M8
  readiness surface.

### Phase 678 - Full Release Gates

- Run full backend regression and frontend release gate after the M8 no-live
  readiness surface is complete.

### Phase 679 - Milestone Evidence

- Mark M8 readiness prep complete only if gates and reviews pass, while
  keeping actual controlled live enablement pending until a live phase is
  explicitly approved.

### Phase 680 - Commit And Final Batch Summary

- Commit backend and frontend work separately, then summarize implementation,
  verification, live posture, commits, and the next approved phase range.

## Completion Evidence - Phases 661-680

- Phase range 661-680 completed M8 live-enablement readiness prep while
  keeping controlled live execution pending.
- Backend `GET /api/v1/admin/live-enablement` now exposes read-only M8
  readiness, cap, approval, guard, audit, per-path, and reconciliation
  evidence.
- Live-place and live-cancel Admin API paths remain `live_enabled=false`,
  `live_eligible=false`, and `status=live_disabled`.
- Dynamic evidence maps use an open-object schema while preserving plain dict
  runtime behavior.
- Backend examples now show `paths`, `checks`, `read_only`,
  `reconciliation_required`, and `live_eligible_path_count`.
- Blind/contextless M8 review found no blockers. It found two clarity gaps;
  both were remediated before completion.
- Backend autonomous queue validation passed with approved phase range
  `661-680`.
- Backend focused Admin API contract checks passed with `62 passed,
  1 warning`.
- Backend full regression passed with `789 passed, 1 warning`.
- Frontend `npm run release:gate` passed with `177` unit tests and `3`
  Playwright tests.
- Live Coinbase execution was not run; submitted notional `$0`, executed
  notional `$0`.
