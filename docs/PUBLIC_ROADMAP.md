# Public Roadmap

This roadmap contains public, non-sensitive work that can be discussed without
private model routing, private release planning, or internal research notes.

## Current Direction

- Keep the public repo runnable and reviewable without private orchestration.
- Maintain strict module ownership boundaries for smaller-agent work.
- Preserve the existing regression suite as the public release gate.
- Continue moving toward v3-style compact, consistent modules without a rewrite.

## Near-Term Public Work

- Enforce ownership boundaries with `.agents/ownership.yaml` and
  `tools/check_ownership.py`.
- Keep dashboard message contracts synchronized with implemented behavior.
- Keep stealth exchange-truth invariants documented and covered by regression
  tests.
- Reduce root-level historical/debug clutter by archiving or moving it behind
  explicit owners.

## Non-Public Work

Private repo only:

- model selection and routing
- private agent prompts
- private release scripts and release-only tests
- private future roadmap and research notes
- agent run logs and eval output
